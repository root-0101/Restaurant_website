# Resturant Website 

I designed this website for a Web-development competetion where, I secured first place 🏆 in the competition organized by our college's technical club. This competition was an incredible experience, where I was challenged to design a website UI using HTML and CSS within a three-hour timeframe, based on themes such as Restaurant, Gym, and Book Store.
